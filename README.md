# SatoshiVote
A Python 3.8 proof of concept for blockchain election voting. 

## Theory
Assuming each citizen in a country submits a Bitcoin address that they control and this is recorded with their name by the government then they could vote by sending a satoshi to the bitcoin address that corresponds with their preferred candiate.

## Disadvantages
* Bitcoin is not currently adopted on a large enough scale.
* The records of Bitcoin address ownership would be target for manipulation.
* Each citizen must pay to take part in the election (although this amount is negligible).
